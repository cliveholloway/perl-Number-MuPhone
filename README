Number::MuPhone

Parse, display and dial phone numbers...

WHY ANOTHER PHONE NUMBER PARSER?

Whilst trying to parse a lot of phone numbers (several million), I found
Number::Phone. On the surface, it looked like a great fit, but it
runs an internal cache that behaves like a memory leak when used
in batch mode to parse large numbers of source phone numbers.

I started digging, and soon realized that I couldn't easily fix
the caching issue without having to rewrite a lot of the underlying
approach. There's a lot of interesting functionality in the module,
but a large chunk of that is not really useful for my main business
case, so I decided to roll out a new module to address my needs
(and hopefully the needs of others, at the same time)

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

REBUILDING THE MODULES

What gets pushed to CPAN is the latest snapshot, though it may not be
up to date. You can rebuild the modules yourself by checking out the
git repo (TODO: add repo url)
and replacing the etc/PhoneNumberMetadata.xml file with the
latest from Google's libphonenumber repo

I am committed to updating the module monthly, when libphonenumber 
changes, but leave it to your own intiative if you want to be bleeding
edge.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
